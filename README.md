# Logistic-Regression-using-NumPy
# Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

    Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch.

    Perform logistic regression with NumPy and Python.

    Create data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
You will  implement gradient descent and logistic regression from scratch using NumPy and Python, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning.
